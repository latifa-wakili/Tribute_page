               <li><strong>1933</strong>- Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br/>
                   to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
               <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br/>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br/> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
               <li> <strong>1937</strong>- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
               <li><strong>1938</strong>- Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br/>cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br/>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
               <li><strong>1941</strong>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br/> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br/>to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
               <li><b>1942</b>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
               <li><b>1944</b>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br/>
                  pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br/> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br/>resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
               </li>
               <li><b>1945</b>-Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
               <li><b>1953</b>- crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br/>American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br/>provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
               <li><b>1962</b>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br/>subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
               <li><b>1970</b>- receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
               <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br/>sorghum yields</li>
               <li><b>1984</b>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
               <li><b>2005</b>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br/>
                  that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br/>
                  we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br/>because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br/>time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
               </li>
               <li><b>2009</b>- dies at the age of 95.</li>
