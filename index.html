               <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br/>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br/> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>

               <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br/>
                  pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br/> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br/>resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
               </li>
               <li><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
